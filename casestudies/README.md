# Open Source Program Case Studies

We have seen a recent trend in open source program formation. We have seen companies like AWS [build out an open source program](http://fortune.com/2016/12/01/amazon-open-source-guru/) via [@AWSOpen](https://twitter.com/AWSOpen) and even companies like [VMWare hired their first Chief Open Source Officer](https://thenewstack.io/makers-dirk-hohndel-vmware-role-open-source-commercial-software/).

We've had many organizations approach TODO Group members asking for advice on how to get started with an open source program and we have decided to build out case studies from our membership to share best practices:

* [Autodesk](autodesk.md)
* [Capital One](capitalone.md)
* [Comcast](comcast.md)
* [Dropbox](dropbox.md)
* [Facebook](facebook.md)
* [Microsoft](microsoft.md)
* [Oath](oath.md)
* [Red Hat](redhat.md)
* [Salesforce](salesforce.md)

If you have an open source program and you're interested in adding a case study, please send a pull request!
