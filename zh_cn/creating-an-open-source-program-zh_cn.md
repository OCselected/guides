# 如何创建开源项目办公室

处于中心位置的开源项目办公室是在公司内部成立的一个指定的部门，用户开源的支持、培育、共享、诠释、以及增长，通过这样一个机构，企业可以明确地建立和执行开源战略，为其公司的决策层、开发人员、营销人员以及其他员工提供必要的工具，从而让开源帮助公司在运营中取得成功。

本文的目标是帮助读者理清楚为什么、以及如何在公司的内部去建立这样的一个部门，进而去管理开源的使用，更为重要的是会告诉读者如何去让公司的开发者去参与到外部的开源项目中去。开源办公室所涉及到的类别有：角色和职责、公司结构、开源管理项目的因素、如何选择和雇佣开源项目经理等等。

## Why create an open source program office

当今的时代，开源软件已经是企业使用的主流形式，几乎囊括了所有的行业：零售、金融、汽车等等。然而，这些企业的执行领导和决策者们却并不了解开源本身。

这样就引来了一个大问题，开源软件的使用和管理采用传统的业务规划行不通，尽管企业在其它方面可能一直以来都运营的非常顺利和成功。开源创新有其自身独特的一套方法论，甚至和传统的企业流程还有点格格不入，其中最大的一个不同点就是开源的开发是协作和透明的，而传统的软件和企业则往往采用的是封闭的和专有的。对于很多企业来讲，采用开源的方法需要更改固有的做法，往往会遇到极大的困难和障碍。

解决以上问题就是设立开源项目办公室的最大优势。通过创建开源项目办公室，企业可以启用、精简、组织等方式来看待开源的利用，从而直接和企业的长期业务规划齐头并进。开源项目办公室旨在成为公司级别的开源运营和架构的核心，帮助将所有必需的组件集中到一起。

这其中包括代码的使用、分发、选型、审计以及其它的政策，乃至培训开发者、确保法律上的合规性、以及激励和构建社区的参与。**开源项目办公室还要做公司内外部的所有和开源相关的布道和沟通。**

> "[每家公司都应该成立一个开源项目办公室](http://www.ocselected.org/posts/business_model/whats_open_source_program_office/)，其要有一个合理而雄心勃勃的计划来影响软件生态系统的各个部门。如果企业要加大其影响力的话、清晰的传达开源的消息、最大限度的发挥项目的影响力、或者是提高其产品开发的效率，开源项目办公室无论在哪个方面，都可以很好的发挥相应的效用。John Mark Walker 开源创业者网络（OSEN）的创始人 "

## The role of the open source program office  

归根结底，开源项目办公室是要体现出其价值的，其要在公司内部鼓励开源的使用、参与贡献、以及创造，从而让公司获得战略上的优势。

一个成功的开源项目办公室可以通过为开发者及其团队建立流程，从而为企业在使用开源方面获得巨大收益。它能够鼓励编码的标准、组织的实践、流程的建立、以及优良工具集的使用。同时，开源项目办公室可以帮助开发者避免或消除不必要的、呆板的流程，以帮助项目顺利的开发等等

开源项目办公室所负责的事情形形色色，多种多样，其中包括：

* 清楚地传达公司内外的开源战略
* 是战略的负责人，并监督战略的执行（请参考创建企业开源战略的指南）
* 促进商业产品和服务中开源的有效使用
* 确保代码是以高质量、不间断经常的方式向开源社区发布的
* 与开发人员社区合作，并要监督公司有效地回馈社区
* 在公司内部培养开源文化
* 维护开源的许可证合规，要审核和监视

对于公司来说，每家遇到的情况可能不一样，那么开源项目办公室的角色也要根据业务、产品、目标等进行相应的调整。目前还没有一个适用于所有公司的开源项目办公室模板，即使是单个行业的所有公司也是不可能的。这就很大程度上在创建过程中会遇到一些挑战，但是你可以从其它公司所分享的经验中学习，将之糅合以适应贵公司的特定需求。

> "在企业应用开源，是没有一套万能钥匙的，我是没法告诉你‘我所说的就是灵丹妙药，包治百病’。" - [Jeff McAffer](https://twitter.com/jeffmcaffer), [微软开源项目办公室](https://opensource.microsoft.com/resources/office)总监.

过去几年来，微软一直致力于创建和改进自己的开源方法。上万名援用分布在不同业务部门，微软成立了专门的开源项目办公室，致力于帮助开发者、营销团队以及其他和开源有关的参与云服务、硬件和软件产品，游戏，内容，媒体等产品线的人员。每个不同的部门都有不同的述求，因此无法用相同的产品为他们提供服务，所以要依据于其各自的业务模式和实际场景进行个性化的服务。

其中开源项目办公室的一个关键角色，就是当业务部门开始在做规划时考虑开源的时候，能够帮助他们澄清事实以及阐释开源的实质，从而让业务部门能够理解为什么要考虑开源？开源之后可能的后果是什么？当然也会提供达到目标需要的资源等。这通常是一个讨论会话的问题，以便利益相关者知道从何时开始，以及在决定权重的时候应该考虑什么。

开源项目办公室也扮演着开发者和开源用户社区之间桥梁和协调的角色，来处理一些相关的事务或需求。当然还会处理一些法律的问题，为开发者提供支持，以及代表公司的开源项目向外部用户发出一些声音。甚至开源项目办公室还会帮助在公司内部传达一些信息，如产品管理团队、代码维护者等。此外，开源项目办公室还会增加专门的开发者布道师这样的角色，从而聚焦确保他们的项目增长和可持续发展。

## Example: Open source program at Google

对于Google来说，哪里使用开源是一个很重要的任务，从公司创立之初就对开源情有独钟，目前为止，是蛮成功的，开源项目办公室的作用一直是功不可没。该办公室经理 Will Norris 表示，该办公室于2004年启动，主要是为了理解和组织使用开源许可证和代码的合规工作。当时谷歌的规模要小得多，并且参与了广泛的开源项目和代码使用，但当时没有太多的正式合规流程。随着公司的增长，合规性的缺失渐渐成为了大问题，所以到2004年才开始进行转变，

> Norris 曾经在开源办公室工作了4年，在进入开源办公室之前是一名软件工程师，他在2016年9月晋升为该办公室的经历。

Google 运营自己的开源项目办公室坚持三个重要的原则：

1. 帮助其员工使用开源项目
2. 发布开源到开源社区
3. 支持更为广泛的来自全球的开源生态

这些原则一直都被很好的执行，从创始伊始就一直坚持这样，而且值得夸耀的是，他们只有15名团队成员，却服务于全公司72000名员工。

Google 开源办公室更多的努力是去保持开源生态系统的健康发展，如通过雇佣有丰富经验的优秀工程师专门在相应的开源项目上专心工作，投资给一些需要金钱的开源基金会、组织和项目，当然也会定期的赞助一些传播开源软件创作的理念和实践的技术研讨会等等。

Google 开源办公室也会开发和运营一些诸如[Google 代码夏令营](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)这项的公益项目，Google 代码夏令营为全球的在校的大学生提供参与开源项目的机会，让这些学生们可以利用暑假在开源社区的导师们的训练和指导下进行编码。

对于Google 开源办公室来说，代码夏令营这样的项目是示范性的，其带来的益处是巨大的，也是有目共睹的—— 要知道参与项目的这些学生都是具备开发潜力的，他们很有可能在未来毕业时选择Google作为他们的雇主，那时已经是拥有丰富开发经验和开源开发的实战经验的工程师了。在开源的世界里，类似的策略也同样让其他的公司受益，因为开源项目办公室在社区的投入让学生们有了参与社区的机会。

Google的大多数开源社区管理都在其众多产品团队中进行，开源项目办公室给予团队和项目支持以遵循他们想要的路径。各个项目的业务目标各不相同，具体取决于在每种情况下开源项目是否合理。 目前在Google 正在进行中开源项目大约有 2000~4000 个。


> "Google 允许公司各个业务部门自行做出决定，因为开源的理由总是各式各样的，要回归到商业上让其自行定夺。作为开源办公室，非常乐意看到大家采用各自认为最好的方法，来实现自己的目标。开源项目办公室更大程度起到的是促进和建议的作用。" - [Will Norris](https://twitter.com/willnorris?lang=en)，Google 开源项目办公室经理

Google 开源项目办公室的合规性团队有两名律师、活动参加的推广团队、以及一个工程团队，工程团队会开发一些工具如帮助自动的合规性检查，也会支持公司的其它开发团队。开源办公室还有另外一个非常重要的职责就是仔细而不间断的跟踪公司范围内所使用带开源项目状况，其中包括构建的合规性、代码引入和发布的时间等。

最近，Google的开源项目办公室又有了一个新的职能，那就是鼓励公司的所有工作人员，在他们主要的开源工作（图形设计师、技术作者、营销人员或开发者）之外，要去花20%的时间去参与到公司其他的项目中去。这个想法是促进团队之间更多的交叉合作，这可以帮助他们相互理解并改进公司层面上的全局项目。


## Establishing an open source office   

对于每家公司来讲，设立开源项目办公室都将会是独特的一系列的决策的开始。这个过程可以是自上而下的，即从管理高层直接干涉；也可以是自下而上的，因为有大把的开发者和开源爱好者已经使用了开源项目，希望让这些都常态化。它可以表现为围绕法律问题和安全制定指导的愿望，它也可以作为成熟和吸引企业领导者关注的基层努力开始。它也可以是由 CEO 或 CTO所提出的战略思考，希望通过开源让企业更进一步发展，为未来增加筹码。如此的共识和行政上的支持对于获得牵引力，以及推动开源的进展至关重要。

那么你该如何开启开源项目办公室之旅了呢？这里有一些重要的步骤供参考：

### 1. 寻找带头人

无论计划如何开始，重要的是找到合适的领导者来帮助开发并运营公司内部刚刚起步的项目办公室。顶尖级的候选人对于开源是如何工作的细节了如执掌，有的甚至本身就在现有的开源项目中的开发者、贡献者或提交者，也就是说本身是打着技术烙印的。候选人应对公司的业务有着广泛而深入的理解，并具备商业敏锐度和一定的管理技能，以帮助制定业务部门的战略和计划。候选人也需要善于交际，这样他们才能将热情、知识和信息传递给他人，并帮助人们去理解开源项目将如何转变，更改以及改进公司的事情。项目办公室的头门需要能够和人们深入的讨论技术，但是他们不需要知道每个项目非常细的细节，因为他们有太多的项目需要关注。

本着开源协作的精神，目前已存在大量的在线资源可以帮助找到最佳的候选人，其中包括针对[开源项目经理](http://todogroup.org/blog/sample-job-req/) 的职位[详细描述的示例](https://github.com/todogroup/job-descriptions)，更何况已经有很多的公司已经设立了此岗位，可以去看看 Capital One、Box、 VMware、 Microsoft Twitter以及 Yahoo等公司是怎么做的。

### 2. Define your operations

预算、人员、技术工具以及系统，这些都是新建立项目办公室在日常运营下必须的关键内容。有些公司开始的时候设立了兼职的经理，但是这么做是远远不够的，因为开源办公室会占用大量的时间来处理各种事情，最好的方法，仍然是让某人担任全职工作，这是让项目办公室成功的前提，如果能够一个小型的团队则更加的棒。

如果项目办公室规模已经很大了，那么就有可能出现中心化的趋势。你要尽可能的让开发者和开源社区保持良好的关系，尤其是符合公司内部的流程。大型的开源办公室要提人们承担更多的职责，而不是让大家自行解决。

一个典型的开源项目办公室，就是驱动需要的策略、流程以及工具，同时要解决一些内部的摩擦，让事情良好的运作，使用工具来自动化那些可精简的内容，并要委派一些必须的任务给相应的图阿奴地。我们将在以下部分介绍如何设置策略和流程的更多细节。

开源项目办公室必须提供结构化的策略和流程，但也要保持一定的灵活性。当开源的用户和贡献者需要帮助的时候，办公室要即使的提供诸如咨询、指导，且要告诉员工可以进行独立的决定。归根结底，开源项目办公室的目标是建立起在责任和义务之间进行适当的平衡，从而以满足公司和开源用户的需求。

### 3. 收集反馈以及 buy-in

创建开源项目办公室和任何事情一样，不可能凭空产生，正因为它处于公司的中心位置，所以成功的创立它需要开放的心态、诚实的态度，要去不断的付出并从企业内部所有参与的部门收集反馈。并要确保从高管到开发人员的每个人都有发言权，这将有助于提供广泛的支持。

> "如果你的目标是要真正掌握你的公司在开源方面的做法，在两个方向上 - 释放和引入 - 它确实需要考虑你真正关心的核心事情是什么。 尽可能简化流程，专注于这些事情，然后再尽可能多地自动化。" - [Will Norris](https://twitter.com/willnorris)，Google 开源项目办公室经理

## 项目办公室的结构

So how and where should open source program offices fit inside a company's organizational structure? Should it be inside the engineering department? Or in the legal department, the CTO's office or in another specific business unit? Again, that depends on your company's primary business and your open source strategy.

### 法律

For companies that have large intellectual property portfolios, that could mean the open source program office might be a perfect fit in the legal office, where developers can work closely with the legal team on issues that arise. That might be a good fit for a hardware company because it’s always concerned about potentially running into IP-related legal issues.

### 工程

Other companies are more engineering-driven, so they choose to maintain their open source program offices within their engineering departments. That allows them to focus their efforts directly on making their developers more effective and productive in their work.

### 开发者关系，市场以及沟通

还有一种情况，有些开源项目办公室设在了组织的营销部门内部，因为公司是使用开源的渠道来销售基于开源代码构建的产品。

At Twitter, where open source use has been integral to the company's success, developers were finding it difficult to contribute back to open source projects starting in 2010 because the company's legal department had serious concerns about code licensing and related issues. Developers and software engineers responded by seeking ways to automate the license compliance processes – to "grease the wheels" – to alleviate the concerns of the legal and engineering departments. The result was the hiring of an open source program manager and the creation of an open source program office to fix processes, streamline procedures, bring in tools to automate tasks and make other needed changes.

Intriguingly, Netflix took a different approach and chose not to create or use a centralized open source program office, says Andrew Spyker, the manager of the company's container cloud. Instead, the streaming movie and entertainment company organizes its open source use through a [small, cross-functional working group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq__rmr0Qe8&t=547s) that runs an internal mailing list for discussions and meets informally once a month to help each other resolve open source issues. The volunteer working group members assist other decentralized teams, leaving everyone with less need to focus on administrative tasks such as legal issues, tools, monitoring and community promotion. For Netflix this is a workable approach because it's an entertainment company and not a software company.

At Microsoft, the structure of its open source program office, which is inside its engineering department, is unique because it has some 60,000 software engineers to support. That large number of developers required a move away from the idea that the details of all open source projects would have to go through one centralized office, which would have been overwhelmed and unworkable. Instead, for things that can't be automated, the company's open source program office team enables engineers to make local decisions about their projects, rather than having to attempt to navigate a centralized bottleneck that could gum up the operations.

Under its process, Microsoft engineers can go into the company's open source workflows, share that they want to use a piece of code or release something to an open source community, and then receive responses from local reviewers who provide feedback. About 300 different groups of business and legal reviewers are available to weigh in on the localized requests with their expertise, helping to provide a workable approach for the company through a highly specialized process.

> "If we tried to have a centralized body to approve open source for Windows, Office, and Azure, we would be pulling our hair out. Those are fundamentally different businesses. We give **engineers** the tools and guidance to enable their work, but are not a **central approval body**. That works in some companies but would not work here." - [Jeff McAffer](https://twitter.com/jeffmcaffer), director of the [Open Source Programs Office at Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com/resources/office)

## 管理角色

在创建开源项目办公室时，还必须做出决定，即要去确定开源项目经理、公司的法律团队以及由工程师和高管组成的审核委员会的角色和责任。

### 项目经理

For maximum effectiveness, the program manager should be empowered as an executive-level position with direct oversight and hands-on management of the company's interests in its open source activities. That would give them the tools they need to lead the way inside an enterprise toward its open source goals and vision.

Microsoft uses an Open Source Executive Council, which is similar to a review board. The group, which is made up of vice presidents from all the major business units inside the company, provides board of directors-style guidance on policy changes and introductions, sets priorities for the open source program, and assists in driving changes in behavior.

### Legal

Like every other function inside a company, legal teams must have a say in the operations of the open source program office to ensure compliance with laws, open source licensing agreements, and other legal details. Specific to open source, the legal team needs to be responsible for ensuring that a company can consume code internally and contribute back to projects with acceptable terms. Larger organizations should consider hiring or training a dedicated attorney to advise their open source program. But you could also use a part-time, knowledgable staff member or outside counsel. It is often helpful to work with an attorney who is knowledgeable and experienced with open source licensing and IP as it can be a specialized, and at times baffling, legal domain relative to commercial contracts or standards.

### Compliance Team

The open source compliance team is a cross-disciplinary group consisting of various individuals tasked with the mission of ensuring open source compliance. The core team, often called the Open Source Review Board (OSRB), consists of representatives from engineering and product teams, one or more legal counsel, and the compliance officer (who is often the open source program manager).

The extended team consists of various individuals across multiple departments that contribute on an ongoing basis to the compliance efforts. These may include documentation, supply chain, corporate development, IT, localization and an Open Source Executive Committee (OSEC). However, unlike the core team, members of the extended team are only working on compliance on a part-time basis, based on tasks they receive from the OSRB. Samsung program manager Ibrahim Haddad’s book, [Open Source Compliance in the Enterprise](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/open-source-compliance-enterprise/), provides a detailed discussion on the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in achieving open source compliance.

### Developer Relations, Advocacy, and Evangelists

Open source developer relations and evangelists can be important to a fledgling open source program office because they can work to build interest and enthusiasm within a company's developer community for specific projects, which can help grow the efforts and increase teamwork among engineers. Evangelists often go to conferences and tech events and explain what open source is to help audiences understand how it can be used and what challenges and opportunities it offers, while sharing their corporate experiences with the open source community.

### Others

In addition, the creation of other job roles is important for the success of the open source program office, including tool administrators, training managers, integration developers for tools and systems, deployment support staffers, implementation project leads, and open source evangelists. Tool administrators, for example, are needed to help select, provide and integrate needed tools for engineers working on their open source projects, while also ensuring the tools meet the licensing and other requirements of an enterprise.

## Setting policy and processes

With many of the other important components now planned or assembled for your company's open source program office, from its creation to its structure to personnel, the next step is to develop well-defined policies and processes which will enable consistent implementation of your company's open source strategy.

The policies should lay out the requirements and rules for working with open source across the company, as well as documented and executable processes which will ensure the rules are followed on a day-to-day basis.

Crucially, they should require minimal overhead. Microsoft looks at its open source program office policies and processes with the goal of making them as unobtrusive as possible for developers and other team members. The approach is to repeatedly eliminate, automate and delegate when reviewing existing open source policies and processes so the rules are constantly questioned and updated to streamline procedures. That means asking why policies are even in place and how they can be improved for users.

> "Having a well-defined policy in place, that's great, but it's got to be a well-defined minimal policy. Otherwise you get lawyers, security folks, business folks, all piling in their concerns and constraints. Soon you end up with a strait jacket full of policy that basically means that nobody can do anything." -[Jeff McAffer](https://twitter.com/jeffmcaffer), director of the [Open Source Programs Office at Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com/resources/office)

Even as those rules are carefully created for open source program offices, companies must be prepared to evolve and modify the rules and procedures as needed over time as their businesses change and as their open source engagements mature and grow.

This may sound like yet another daunting step in the process, but like open source code itself, sample rules and processes are available from open source silos and can be implemented and customized by enterprises, making your tasks easier.

Among the best examples of such rules are from Google, which early in 2017 published its [open source policies](https://opensource.google.com/docs/) for review and free use so others can learn how the company uses, releases and supports open source and how it's involved in projects and communities. Some of the content is scrubbed for security and privacy reasons, but it provides many lessons learned in how the company does its work.

When drafting open source policies, among the many topics that need to be discussed are:

* 贵公司如何接受自己的员工为外部的开源项目做贡献
* 如何准备开源的发布
* 如何审批所收到的贡献或反馈
* 开发者们该如何使用从GitHub或其它代码仓库中搜到的代码
* 解释如何将开源代码引入公司的程序和规则
* 如何将传入的代码编入目录以便其他人知道它正在被使用
* 一家公司如何围绕开源项目，去组织一个志同道合的社区，且多是外部的开发人员，还要保持蓬勃发展
* 这些规则有助于确定代码何时应以开源形式发布或保存为知识产权

### 发布代码的政策

You want to help people be successful in making contributions to open source projects and in releasing their own projects. Guidelines and checklists ensure that developers have everything they need to release their code as open source without running into licensing or confidentiality issues. Especially for new contributors, it can also help to have an internal review process available as a safe place to get feedback before making a contribution. (See our guide on Participating in Open Source Communities.)

Your organization should also strive to adopt an "upstream first" development policy. By submitting patches to the upstream open source project first, and incorporating them into your own products downstream, you will avoid spending a massive amount of time and money on re-engineering after each release.

### 接受贡献的规则

Unless your open source projects are housed at a neutral foundation, you’ll want to [...] Rules that set out procedures for your company to receive contributions to your own open source projects from external developers are particularly important.

> "You actually don't want to be the only people contributing to your open source project. You want to have people outside your company contribute to your open source project, because at the end of the day, there's no way to hire all the smartest people in the world. It's impossible. Even if you're Google, it's still impossible." - [Chris Aniszczyk](https://twitter.com/cra?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), COO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

That is, of course, one of the benefits of putting your company's open source code out into other communities and inviting other developers to establish an interest in your own projects. Because in the grand scheme of things, even though they are not officially your employees, you can have brilliant people working on your company's code from around the world, making it better and expanding its capabilities. This kind of collaboration is important for companies and is a common focus for many open source program offices.

### Policies to promote adoption

You also want to encourage others to use your code in their products and services. This is key to building ecosystems that in turn help grow and sustain your open source projects. Policies for open source use can come in a variety of innovative forms.

Red Hat has a unique policy by defaulting to open source with its newly-created code in most cases from the start. That means that when developing each piece of software inside the company, it is assumed that in the future it may be destined to be released as open source. This is intriguing because typically there is a different attitude among engineers for releasing their code as open source because other people will then be looking at it.  Due to that scrutiny, they tend to structure things in better ways when writing open source, creating cleaner code with fewer or improved code dependencies in their work.

### Policies for internal consumption

Other needed policies include rules about how and where your team finds trusted sources for open source software use and creation, policies about establishing code management and maintenance procedures, and formalizing community interaction for your projects. (See our guide on Using and Distributing Open Source Code.)

An open source usage policy ensures that any software (proprietary, third-party, or open source) that makes its way into the product base has been audited, reviewed, and approved. It also ensures that your company has a plan to fulfill the license obligations resulting from using the various software components, before your products make it to customers.

For example, your policy could require engineers to receive approval from your organization’s auditing staff, such as an open source review board (OSRB), before integrating any open source code in a product. It may also state that software received from third parties must be audited to identify any open source code included, which ensures license obligations can be fulfilled before a product ships.

### Policies for compliance

Also needed are policies to formalize and establish legal compliance procedures and to assure executive oversight for the program. (See our ebook, Open Source Compliance in the Enterprise, for a detailed compliance program.)

You’ll also want to map out how you’ll handle the software tools that will make much of the compliance and code testing work possible by automating it and streamlining procedures for developers and contributors. For example, the[I think we need to mention SPDX and OpenChain tools from The Linux Foundation, along with help from yourand working with internal supply chain teams, will internally to ensure that code brought in by third parties is also compliant.]

There's a broad array of open source (e.g. FOSSology) and fee-based proprietary tools in the marketplace today that can help with these important tasks. For most open source program offices, a high-quality and comprehensive collection of tools can be brought together without the need to build your own custom tools. Again, much of this is due to open source collaboration, where contributing developers have created and refined the tools which can handle these tasks for enterprises. And if the tools don't do exactly what your project needs, then users can contribute back to modify and improve them to gain the capabilities they seek. Getting involved in the open source community around enterprise tooling is something that your open source program office will likely support.

Existing open source resources are also potential gold mines for finding other materials needed by your open source projects, including documentation for contributor license agreements (CLAs). CLAs define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to open source software. "define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to a company/project, typically software under an open source license."[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement)] Projects that use CLAs require contributors, and often their companies, to sign the CLA agreements before contributions will be accepted by the project.

Many companies have written their own CLAs, but generic versions are available as open source agreements which one can use without starting from scratch. Most of what you will need can be found in a template and then you can customize the CLAs to cover any issues that remain. Attorneys from other potential contributing companies will often appreciate reuse of standard terms.

Google regularly uses a variety of tools to perform automated code checks using features such as custom filters, which can scan code bases to check for licenses, license compatibility, and other factors. Each time Google releases a new version of Android or other application, it undergoes an automated process for checking license compliance, simplifying procedures for the company. Automation quickens making the argument to engineers that the process is simple and seamless and won't burden them to use for their applications.

All new Google engineers are also required to go through a one-hour open source class where licensing and compliance are stressed as part of how the company does business. A key lesson shared by the company is that not only is Google obligated by licensing legalese to comply with licenses, but that it also complies because it's the right thing to do for the community. Google's lawyers are available to represent the company if an obvious mistake is made in licensing or code use, but the company is very sensitive about potentially submitting code that could harm its standing in the community.

> "Angering our friends in the open source community would be devastating. It's not something we would ever want to do because we care about this community, we're part of it. For companies that are new to open source, I think they often fail to recognize the importance of that." - [Will Norris](https://twitter.com/willnorris?lang=en), open source office manager at Google

## 写在最后

当你所在的公司决定了要创建开源项目办公室的时候，这意味着有大量的工作要做，也有很多事情需要考虑，尽管这样，其所带来的效果绝对大于你所付出的努力。要找到正确的领导者来驱动项目办公室的初始化工作是成功的重要一步。


> "这是文化变革的努力。代码确实是非常明显的一部分，但是社区以及鼓励却是人与人之间的事情，如果你有意建立开源项目办公室的话，你就要去尝试真实的事情，你要去理解文化的内涵，去找到能够帮助将文化推向新水平的人，开源主管真的是一个变革的推动者。 " - [Jeff McAffer](https://twitter.com/jeffmcaffer)，[Microsoft开源项目办公室](https://opensource.microsoft.com/resources/office)总监
